S3 only grant access to the owner who create the bucket by default
each object is 5GB by default, the bucket is unlimited 

Static website hosting need to have unblock all public access
and update bucket policy in permission

Encryption
    Client side - client controls both keys
    SSE-C (server side Encryption with customer-managed keys)
    SS3-S3 (server side Encryption with S3-managed keys)
        AES-256 encryption
    SSE-KMS (server side Encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys)

Single PUT upload
    5gb is the limit, single transfer (no failover)
Multipart upload
    broken up to 10,000 part, each part is 5 MB to 5GB

Version
    not enable by default, per bucket bases. never disable version only suspend
    when version enabled, deleting an object means only add a delete marker
        the object is not actually deleted (recycle bin)
        if delete the marker, the object is back (undo)
        have to delete all version of the object

MFA delete 
    need a MFA token to delete an object

Presigned URL
    give the object temporary access as the user's identity 
    will expire
    if cannot access presigned URL either
        expired, permission of the creator of the URL has changed
        or the IAM role who created the presigned URL expired 
        can get/put depends on the owner's permission

https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/

all the storage type is object

S3 Standard
    general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data
    no minimum object size or retrieval fee
    99.99999999999 durability and four nines availability

S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    data with unknown or changing access patterns
    Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
    Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
    type of storage class that move object between two tiers
    one designed for frequent access, another one is for infrequent
    minimum 30 days 
life cycle rule
    object smaller than 128kb cannot be use Intelligent-Tiering
    must be in the original storage class for minimum of 30 days
    
S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 
    cheaper than standard.
    30 day and 128kb minimum charges and object retrieval fee
    3+ AZ replication

S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
    long-lived but less frequently accessed data
    none-critcal and/or reproducible objects
    only 1 AZ, 30days and 128kb minimum change
    Cant use for important data

Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier)
    long term archival storage (Warm or cold backup)
    3+ AZ replication 90 days and 40 kb minimum 
    retrievals can take mins or hours

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive)
    long-term archive and digital preservation
    180 days and 40 kb minimum
    longer retrievals - replacement for tape backup

Cross region replication
    keep storage class (can change), object name, owner, object permission
    need IAM role
    doesnt replicate existing objects and it is one way only
    lifecycle event/rule not replicated 
    SSE-C not supported, only SSE-S3 and KMS supported
