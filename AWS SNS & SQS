SQS
Add message to a queue and pull the message out from anther end\
queue can add resource permission
short polling
    pull all the message ASAP even with 0 message
    increase amount of API calls
long polling - preferable way
    wait for message to arrive by giving the WaitTimeSeconds
Message only get hiddne
have to delete the message or it will return to the queue
    by using the receipt handle command


Standard or FIFO queue
    Standard has unlimited throghput but might have duplicate message and not in order
    FIFO - first in first out, 300 message by default, deliver only once

Mostly use by Lambda for Auto Scaling group
