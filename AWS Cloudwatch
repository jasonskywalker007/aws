It's responsible for metric collection, monitoring, and visualization for most AWS services
can be extended for on-premises infrastructure and custom applications. 
    This lesson walks through the architecture of CloudWatch, including:
        Metrics
        Data points
        Retention
        Namespaces
        Alarms
one hour metric are retained for 455 days
5 mins metric are retained for 63 days
one min metric for 15 days

three states
    insufficient
    alaram
    ok
Alarm key components
    metric 
    thershold
    period
    action
        SNS
        auto scaling
        EC2
cloudwatch anomaly (has a range of metric and atuo detect)

log event
    time stamp and raw message
log stream
    a sequence of log events with the same source
log group
    container for log stream, it controls retetion, monitoring and access control

log metric filter
    create from a log group
    able to search the keyword in the log 
    can create an alarm on top of the filter

cloudtrail 
    auditing tool that logs all the events
    it provides full API/account activity logging across all regions in an account and (optionally) all accounts within an AWS Organization
    event history is the default configuration for cloudtrail
    stores 90 days of events
    not real time and deliver in batches bewteen 5 to 50 mins

VPC flow log
    doesnt monitor the traffic 
    is not real time
    can be enabled on a VPC, subnet, or ENI level and monitor traffic metadata for any included interfaces
        includes DNS server, Windows license activation, 169.254.169.254, DHCP, VPC router
    Source and destination IP addresses
    Source and destination ports
    Protocol
    Bytes
    Start and end
    ALLOW or REJECT status

Cloudwatch event
    patterns or automatically remediating or automatically responding certain patterns 

AWS Cloudwatch

SNS dashboard first
Create a topic
Click Topic, Actions, Subscribe to topic
Give protocol and alert email

Cloudwatch
Metrics, (EC2), (CPU), Graphed metrics, Actions, alarm icon
Name of alarm, Whenever is < 25%, Period (1m)
Under Actions, Send notification to (the Topic just created)

Create a metric filter in the log group
filter pattern - looking for certain word (for troubleshooting)
it will show everytime the word is mentioned
and can create alarm when the word is trigger


IAM
Create a Policy first with EC2 service, with start/stop Action
Next, create a roles, choose a service and the policy to apply to it.
