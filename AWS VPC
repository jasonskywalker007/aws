How to creaet a VPC

Create VPC1
Create VPC internet gateway

    With a Elastic IPv4 
Create a new route table (Private subnet) with the VPC
    Add the private subnets in the Subnet Association
    Add 0.0.0.0/0 and target to NAT gateway

Cant have overlap CIDR


Transitve routing not supported in VPC

VPC endpoints provide access to public AWS services for resources that don't have public IP addressing or where a NAT gateway isn't deployed. 
There are two types of VPC endpoints: gateway endpoints (used for S3 and DynamoDB) and interface endpoints (used for most other AWS services).
Gateway endpoints
    Create endpoints
    select AWS services and find the gateway services from the list
    select the VPC you want to attach to 
    select the route table you want to use
    full access policy
Interface endpoints
    Create endpoints
    select AWS services and find the interface services from the list
    select the VPC you want to attach to 
    select the route table you want to use
    full access policy

Egress-only gateways provide outgoing-only (and response) access for an IPv6-enabled VPC resource.
