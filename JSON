JSON data is written as name/value pairs:
    A name / value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes)
    followed by a colon, followed by a value:
    "firstname" : "David"
 or "lastname" : "Bombal"

Object
    Unordered collection of key:value pairs  
    Data surrounded by curly braces { }
    Key and value are separated by a colon :
    Each key/value pair is separated by a comma , (not the last!). 
    Trailing commas must not be used.
    Use double quotes, not single quotes.
    Boolean values must be lowercase (different to Python)
    Example 1:
        {"firstName": "David", "lastName": "Bombal"}
    Example 2:
        {
            "firstName" : "David",
            "lastName" : "Bombal",
            "website" : "davidbombal.com"
        }
